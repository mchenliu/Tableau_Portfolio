**2. Maps, scatterplots, and dashboards:**
- This dashboard features a map of Europe alongside scatterplots that visualize customer margins, segmented by performance. Margins below 50% are displayed in red to indicate underperformance, while margins above 50% appear in blue, representing satisfactory performance.
- A Year filter is available and applies to all worksheets across the workbook, allowing users to focus on specific time periods. Additionally, an action filter enables users to interact with the dashboard, dynamically updating the customer scatter plot based on their selections
